1.Sunday at least 2 times faster then brute force:
pat = "lol", text = "lolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklol"
reason: You skip a lot in sunday

2.Sunday at least 2 times fatser then KMP:
pat = "lol", text = "lolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklolklol"
reason: You also skip a lot in sunday

3.KMP at least 2 times faster then Rabin - Karp :
pat = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
text = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
you have very many occurances of the same pattern so Hash checks a lot for each one and the pattern is long

4.Rabin-Karp at least 2 times faster then Sunday:
pat = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm,./'][;1234567890"
text = "fiwuehfiwuehfiuwehfiuhfksjdhfkjsdhfjshdjkfjsdfhsjdfhkjsdhfjshdfkjhsdjfksdjsjhkjhaskdjhakjhdakjshdkjasdjakshdkajshdkajhsdkjashdkjashdkjahsdkjahskjdhaksjdhjashdkajshdkjashdkjashdkjahsdkjajkdakjsdhkajshdkjashdkjahskdjhaksjdhkjashdkjashdkjashdkjasdkjasdkjahsdjkahskjdhakjsdhjashdkjashdkjashdkjahsjdhakjsdhakjsdhkjasdhkjashdkjahsdkjahskdhaskjdhakjsdhkajshdkjahsdkjahsdkjahskjdhaksdhakjshdkjashdkjashdkjahsdkjhaskjdhakjsdhakshdkajshdkajshdkajshdkjahsdkjahsdkasdhaksdhakjshdkjashdkjashdkjashdkahsdkjahsdkajshdakjsdhkajshdakjshdkajshdkajshdkjashdkajshdkajshdkajshdkashdkajhsdkajshdkajshdakjshakshdkajshdakjshdkashdakjsdhalsdkjaskldjaksjdkasjdkjaksdjlajsdlasdjaslkdjaslkdjalksdjlkasdlkajsdkljalsdjlasjdlkasjdlkasjdlkasaaslkdjakjshlkashdlkahsdljahsbdjlahsdjashgdkjashgdjkahsgdkjagsdjkagsdkjahgsdjhasgdjakshgdjasgdjasgdjkahsgdjahsgdjagsdjhasgdjashgdjasgdjashgdjkashgdjahsgdjhagsdjkhagsdjkhagsjkdgajshgdakjsgdakjhgsdjkashgdjakshgdja"
Rabin karp doesn't check at all since there are no occurances and also Sunday never skips so it is slower
