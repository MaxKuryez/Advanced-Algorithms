
PatternMatching => implementation of all the algorithms and their runtime test in a project.
I used Text.txt as a text sample and it is just a random text input from keyboard. In which number of characters for 
testing were: 304697, 671413, 1746077.
I stored all the data in Result1.txt, Result3.txt, Result2.txt documents.
But you DON'T need them because the SAME data is presented in the folder Excercise1.

AllAlgorithms => Is not important, it's the same algorithms but in separete files.

Exercise1 => The runtime of algorithms presented in a table and a chart. (For some reason my implementation of
Sunday appears to be the best and Hashing function is very slow) 

Exercise2 => Examples of cases for exercise 2 of the assignment. 

Exercise3 => Implementation of 2D hashing algorithm for two dimentional text. It includes bitmask
instead of modulo. After a pattern in the text has been found it is also being compared with an
actual pattern.
